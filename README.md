## GBM Workshop

Slides & code (and other materials) for an intermediate workshop on GBMs.

Intro talk slides [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vMnTIjuot71grZm8Rifv2ecYAw314qCkGNfeF2NGXUk).

The code covers basic training and scoring in xgboost, h2o and lightgbm and then some additional features such
as early stopping. The code was first developed in R, but then also ported to Python. There is also some code
for tuning GBMs with random search in hyperparameter space, cross-validation etc.
